The reason, he says, is that anyone could use a lockout policy to try logging in to a victim&rsquo;s account, &ldquo;knowing that you won&rsquo;t succeed, but also knowing that the victim won&rsquo;t be able to use the account, either.&rdquo; (Such thoughts may occur to a student facing an unwelcome exam, who could block a professor from preparations.)</p><p style=""font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0px 0px 1em; color: black; line-height: 24px"">VERY short passwords, taken directly from the dictionary, would be permitted in a password system that Mr. Herley and Stuart Schechter at Microsoft Research developed with Michael Mitzenmacher at Harvard.</p><p style=""font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0px 0px 1em; color: black; line-height: 24px"">At the Usenix Workshop on Hot Topics in Security conference, held last month in Washington, the three suggested that Web sites with tens or hundreds of millions of users, could let users choose any password they liked &mdash; as long as only a tiny percentage selected the same one.

You have to know the alphabet before you can &quot;look it up&quot;!</p><p>The problem with our school system is that there is too much fact and too little method, if only because it is easier to test. So what does remain after taking math after you have forgotten what you learned, as most everyone does? What is the answer to Einstein&#39;s question?</p><p>This is what I wanted to find out when I asked what mathematical thinking is. If you apply mathematical thinking to other areas of life, what are you doing? I found an answer to it in one of several papers in a conference in Tokyo in 2008. (My job was to write up the gist of each paper for the APEC website.) The author listed a bunch of skills, but one struck me as more special in mathematics than any other discipline. (I was a math major at U.Va. and took lots of graduate-level courses.) The paper said one technique in solving problems is to:</p><p>Generalize the probem.</p><p>Solve it.</p><p>Apply it to the original problem.</p><p>That is did over and over and over in math courses but nowhere else nearly so much. Doing so gave me a facility I have used all my life. At work when I am asked to research a problem, I often know instantly that I cannot find the exact answers. So I ask, who initiated the question and why? Maybe I can find out something related to the original question. I then go research the larger question.</p><p>Now you might think that what you get out of math courses is the axiomatic method you studied in geometry. However, almost no one tries to solve a problem by using axioms. It has been done for entire disciplines and subdisicplines and it really ought to be done much more often, because it can root out hidden assumptions and get them clarified. However, it would be hard to think of any immediate problems that make use of the deductive method.</p><p>On the other hand generalize-solve-apply is applicable to almost all areas of life. If you take lots of math you are more likely to try out generalize-solve-apply to problems at work or in life, because you will have already had practice doing just this.</p><p>THEREFORE, condense three years of high school math to one and concentrate on math issues that rely on generalize-solve-apply. Go on from there and devote a lot of classes to matter far removed from math that demand use of this method.</p><p>Now I may be very wrong here about math, though I can say that when I explained my idea to the current head of the math department at U.Va. a few years ago on a visit to my alma mater, it struck a bell with him.</p><p>Let me continue this in my answer to Mr. Rexroad.

27,25,61,64,"Maybe Thunderbird Instead","<p>I agree completely about investigating using Gmail, but I haven&#39;t taken the effort to figure out how to move messages into various folders I name myself or to have certain ones flow into these folders automatically.</p><p>For instance, I used to subscribe to a list called Evolutionary Psychology. Lots of ferociously controversial stuff but only occasionally matters pertaining to education. One worthy finding is that subjects that have lots of story telling are more suited to our evolved psychologies than abstract stuff like set theory. So maybe the new math wouldn&#39;t have failed had it been presented in stories! (This does not preclude individual variation, so that some one like me can gobble set theory up most greedily.) Such insights could well inform instruction.</p><p>However, so often management PUSHES something onto our computer that when I get back from the weekend, i have to wait and wait and wait for messages from this list to download from the server and onto my computer before I can do anything else. And more often than not, the messages don&#39;t flow into the folder. I have to reconfigure tools and then move the messages myself. Consequently, I unsubscribed.</p><p>If you have figured out how to get folders working in Gmail, just like they do in Outlook or Thunderbird, please PLEASE let me know how. But if this can&#39;t be done, I do not want Gmail.</p><p>There might be a work around. I believe Thunderbird now lets you download Gmail messges to your own (local) computer. This is good, since you can work on e-mails in case there are problems connecting to the Internet. So, if you can do this, i think you&#39;ll be able to continue working with folders. Your capacity would be limited by whatever you have on your C:\&nbsp; and H:\ drives.</p><p>Maybe we should just convert to Thunderbird and not to Gmail. Still, we must have folders.</p><p>The Washington Post&#39;s computer guy, Bob Pegorado, says to chuck Internet Explorer completely. He may feel the same about Outlook. He should say give Outlook the heave also, since if I want to find a message, I have to go to several different &quot;services&quot; because of the way Outlook messages get shoved into a single file and when that files gives too big, I have to start up a new &quot;service.&quot; Thunderbird has separate files for each folder, but I don&#39;t know how large any one folder can get. (I also do not understand why there should be any limits on the size of any folder, just an overall limit on the size of one&#39;s hard drive. Does anyone know?)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",160.109.63.190,1296760531,0,6,02.00/,"Frank Forman",,

I remember my high school using Windows 95 machines until 2005, for example, and thinking that those machines seemed a bit useless. Of course, I don&#39;t think anyone is talking about sending decades-old computers or cameras to schools, but it is something to consider.</p><p>All that being said, free or reduced-cost equipment for education institutes is never a <em>bad</em> choice.

40,0,81,178,"The essential issue","<p>The problem in our schools is that learning is NOT valued for learning&#39;s sake. It&#39;s valued because it means students will do better on a test in April, and then the school will get more money. Students don&#39;t care that they aren&#39;t learning things the right way as long as they keep getting those little gold stars. Kids have to be brought up from birth enjoying the learning process and enjoying their own growing base of knowledge. Teachers have little autonomy over their subjects, and while that has a noble goal in mind (giving every single student the same criteria for achievement and the same chance for it), it takes a lot of the fun out of it for the teachers and therefore the students as well. I would know, I&#39;ve been one of each.</p><p>I suppose my main point is that learning isn&#39;t something that can be taught except by frequent exposure. When I grew up, my parents were constantly reading to me, or taking me to the book store/library to get me more books. Sure, I watched TV and played video games, but to this day I sitll find it hard to go to sleep unless I&#39;ve been reading. That is not to say that reading is the only way to teach kids or to foster learning growth, but having a learning/educational activity in front of you almost constantly makes that process a part of you the same way having an athletic activity in front of you makes that a part of you.</p><p>Kids have to be exposed by their families from an early age, and it has to be a constant thing for them. We can&#39;t forget that people are all animals, and the more familiar we are with something, the more we enjoy it and the more we cannot live without it. Try taking away your dog&#39;s favorite chew-toy and see what he has to say about it.

69,0,81,64,"Promoting curiosity","<p>Mr. Carithers,</p><p>It is impossible to disagree with you about what *ought* to be done, but the fact is that curiosity is not a common human trait. I bet even you found some of your classes pointless and boring. And in these classes I bet you studied only enough to get a respectable grade, to satisfy yourself, your parents, and peers, and to get a good grade point average to show to your employer or to put in an application for graduate or progessional school.</p><p>History was my least favorite subject. Since grade school, I took only what was required, which were</p><p>1. 7th grade: Colorado history, half a course since it was share equally with conservation.</p><p>2. 8th grade: American history</p><p>3. Ninth grade: medieval and Renaissance history</p><p>4. Second year college: Western civilization</p><p>5. Graduate school: history of economic thought (not sure if this was required, but it had a great teacher, William Breit).</p><p>History started making sense to me when I became an Objectivist after having read Atlas Shrugged during the Summer between third and fourth year of college. (I was a true believer for about a year, because what Ayn Rand basically did was to espouse a theory of virtue but she did not support it empirically.) I read many of the history books she and her circle recommended and saw the grand narrative of history as the story of liberty. Actually, Lord Acton got there first, but I did not know that.</p><p>Now I see history as the unfolding of many themes rather than being driven by a single one. So I read history differently, but history I do read. And I do this in spite of the fact that my ability to remember details is far below my ability to think abstractly.</p><p>What if I did not have to come upon these realizations alone, as I might very well not have? What if one of my teachers had gone beyond the particular area of history the course covered and taught us about history in general, told us how much of it is in dispute, suggesting why these disputes persist (what was the cause of the Civil War?). About the tools historians use? How digging out the facts and constructing narratives is a joy?</p><p>My teachers were not enthusiastic (except Mr. Breit), though I learned that another of my high school teachers was very good. Final exam: answer three questions. You make them up. Cause of the Civil War is no. 1 for me. (Answer: Southerners saw the Northern government as having violated the Constitution and left the union. (Read Emory M. Thomas, The Confederacy as a Revolutionary Experience.) It was not slavery. Lincoln said so. Toward the end, Jefferson Davis offered to free the slaves if Britain would grant it diplomatic recognition, so that Union blocades of exchanges of agricultural products for war materiel would constitute an act of war against Britain.) Argue the point, if you like, but history becomes exciting when you do.</p><p>Where are these teachers? A lot more of them than you imagine. They need to be liberated. So what if class gets bogged down to cover this controversy and other controversies and the ostensible scope of the course greatly neglected? The kids will be excited. They will start to really understand what history is all about. Problem is that the students may not do very well on exams, whether made up by the state or the College Board.</p><p>And if you allow all teachers such liberties, too many of them will become irresonsibly lazy. If they were held accountable, I&#39;d do well on the test (maybe), but so what? I&#39;d forget what I learned. The aftermath probably would not be great if what you get is &quot;one damned thing after another.&quot; Ask yourself, how many conceive of history as the cumulation of random events and an intertwining of many streams? Would I rather have one great teacher than four dull ones in whose courses I did well on their *tests*? Would I even rather have one great teacher and have to have three irresponsible ones?</p><p>I have no answer. There is no universal answer. So, once again let the counties find their own balances. E.D. should do what it can to get NCLB changed to allow this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",160.109.63.190,1299717952,0,6,03/,"Frank Forman",,

191,0,222,74,"Adjust the temperature to match the season","<p>People tend to disagree on what the ambient office temperature should be.&nbsp; I&#39;ll&nbsp;mention four&nbsp;issues on this, followed by a proposal on how we could&nbsp;change the LBJ&nbsp;building&#39;s temperature to better suit everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>1. Consistency in LBJ&nbsp;Temperature&nbsp;--&nbsp;I sit in a 6th-floor&nbsp;cubicle in the west wing, and in my experience I&#39;ve found the LBJ office temperature&nbsp;to be remarkably consistent in the building year-round.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know some people find this temperature to be consistently too cool, and others&nbsp;consistently too warm, but I&#39;m glad it&#39;s a consistent, tolerable&nbsp;temperature.&nbsp; Thank you for that consistency, because it&nbsp;makes it much easier for me&nbsp;to plan&nbsp;what&nbsp;to wear&nbsp;every day so that I&#39;m&nbsp;comfortable sitting&nbsp;at my desk for 8-hour stretches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>2. Hot vs. Cold in the Office -- When it comes to office&nbsp;temperature, it&#39;s safer to be on the cooler side.&nbsp; Hotter temperatures make it harder to think, while&nbsp;colder temperatures make it harder to type, so I&#39;d rather put up with the latter.&nbsp; Also, it&#39;s easier to address cooler temperatures by adding on sweaters and blankets, than to address warmer temperatures with fans and frequent trips to get and replenish&nbsp;icy drinks.</p><p>3. Weather Outdoors -- Washington, D.C. is very seasonal, from outdoor swimming&nbsp;in the summer to sleet&nbsp;and ice in the winter.&nbsp; With regard to attire, this means shorter&nbsp;and thinner clothing in the&nbsp;summer, and&nbsp;longer and thicker clothing in the winter, with&nbsp;umbrellas at the ready for&nbsp;DC&#39;s year-round notoriously humid and unpredictably stormy weather.&nbsp; Often the weather outdoors does not match the office environment indoors.&nbsp; This&nbsp;forces&nbsp;people&nbsp;to throw&nbsp;together&nbsp;outfits that must be&nbsp;suitable for their morning weather commute to the office (e.g., rainy),&nbsp;their 8-hour work day at their desk (e.g., cold),&nbsp;their midday lunch break where they can stretch their legs (e.g., hot), and their afternoon weather commute home (e.g., humid).&nbsp;</p><p>4. Saving Energy and the Environment -- To explain using an extreme example, it makes little sense to waste energy cooling&nbsp;the office&nbsp;in the summer to the point that people in light clothing have to resort to using more energy to&nbsp;plug in&nbsp;heaters at their desks.&nbsp; Similarly, it also makes little sense to keep the office&nbsp;so warm in the winter that people with under warmers (that they can&#39;t easily remove) have to resort to using fans to cool down&nbsp;at their desks.&nbsp; Instead of using a lot of energy working against the seasonal temperatures, why not just use a little energy to moderate extreme temperatures?&nbsp; This means when it&#39;s hot out, make it&nbsp;a little warm inside, and when it&#39;s cold out, make it&nbsp;a little cool inside.&nbsp; This way we save energy, reduce emissions, and make it easier for people to dress for the season regardless whether they&#39;re indoors or outdoors.&nbsp; Additionally, if people don&#39;t have to change their layering when they&nbsp;leave their desk and&nbsp;go outside, it makes it&nbsp;more encouraging to&nbsp;walk outside, stretch your legs, get some fresh air,&nbsp;and be&nbsp;more active and healthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting a few minutes of sun daily&nbsp;also&nbsp;improves mood and well-being.</p><p>Proposal&nbsp;--&nbsp;ED&nbsp;should adjust LBJ&#39;s building temperature to better reflect seasonal fluctuations.&nbsp; Whatever the building&#39;s current temperature is (it does seem like 69&deg;F), maybe lessen the air conditioning so that it only falls down to&nbsp;75&deg;F in the summer, and maybe lessen the heating so that it only rises to 65&deg;F in the winter.&nbsp; That way we don&#39;t need to keep&nbsp;several&nbsp;changes and layers of clothes at the office, and we can spend more time concentrating on our work and going to where we need to go rather&nbsp;than on constantly&nbsp;regulating our&nbsp;temperatures.&nbsp; There&#39;s also the added bonus of&nbsp;saving energy, saving the environment, and promoting our health.</p>",160.109.63.190,1310062675,0,6,05/,"Victoria Tang",,

Those who do truly outstanding work should be rewarded for it with a prompt and public bonus ($5k-$10k per year, perhaps?). It must be a large enough amount to drive performance, and delivered quickly enough that there&#39;s a connection between the work and the pay and a relative amount of certainty that the money will be forthcoming, and publicly so that you can hold up examples of exemplary employees and improve morale. I should note that I&#39;ve heard that pay-for-performance may be implemented under REACH, but I have some doubts--I&#39;m not aware of any bonuses for the outstanding performance of any of my team members thus far under REACH (and at least two people stand out as deserving), and even if a bonus <em>is </em>eventually forthcoming, I fear it won&#39;t really be enough (a couple hundred dollars is nice, but honestly not enough to drive employees&#39; performance).</p><p>Time. Time is one of our most valuable resources--there&#39;s never enough time to spend with family and friends. I know I would do almost anything to have more time. Yet my work hours are fixed: 40 hours per week, regardless of how quickly I get my work done. If I were rewarded with more time for my family (peahaps leaving an hour or two early) if I get my work done quickly (and correctly!), I would have a powerful incentive to work quickly and efficiently.</p><p>Recognition. Public servants in education are overwhelmingly social-oriented people. Nothing means more to us than public recognition for a job well-done. It&#39;s free, and it feels great. Yet most hard work goes entirely unaknowledged--you get a &quot;received&quot; or &quot;approved&quot; in a courrier font email from a blackberry at 7pm. I can count on one hand the number of times I&#39;ve received an honest, heart-felt public thank you from supervisors and management.

319,0,389,602,"For this topic I am going to","<p>For this topic I am going to consider Port Visits to be a form of training in that they are sort of an indoctrination into how different parts of FSA work. &nbsp;Personally, I enjoy the Port Visits. &nbsp;I get to hear from people that I have never seen and get an idea of what they do and why I might need or want to interact with them in the future (or present, for that matter). &nbsp;However, the problem that I have with the Port Visits is that they are somewhat infrequent. &nbsp;As new employees, we are given 1 year to attend all of the Ports (if I remember my onboarding&nbsp;correctly). &nbsp;And judging by the infrequency with which the Ports are offered, it seems that 1 year is a fairly accurate assessment of the time that would be required to make it to all of the Ports. &nbsp;I hope this doesn&#39;t sound as though I am in any way upset about the time between the Ports because I am not. &nbsp;People have their actual jobs to do after all, and can&#39;t be doing ports every other day. &nbsp;This is where my &quot;idea&quot; comes into play... &nbsp;I put the word &quot;idea&quot; in quotes because it is not a very unique or original concept that I am about to propose....</p><p>Why don&#39;t we record these Port Visits? &nbsp;Perhaps store the recordings of these Port Visits in some centralized location and then direct new employees to look for them there and watch them??? &nbsp;I just think that it&#39;s a bit of a hindrance to have all of these new employees waiting an entire year to be introduced to the members and functions of the different business units here at FSA. &nbsp;There could be people working here right now that I might have a very good reason to want/need to interact with, but because I don&#39;t know that person or business unit exists, nor what they do, I would never know. &nbsp;Well, at least not until they have another Port Visit, which might occur sometime in the next 12 months. &nbsp;My point is that we need not wait an entire year to introduce new employees to all of the business units that they want to know about. &nbsp;We are already doing the Port Visits... &nbsp;Heck, we may even be recording them, unbeknownst to me... &nbsp;But if the recordings aren&#39;t stored some place where new employees are directed to look for and watch them, then they aren&#39;t doing anybody much good.</p><p>Now, while I chose to point to Port Visits for this example, I think that the use of video recording can be useful in more cases than that alone. &nbsp;Here is an example that happened recently to me. &nbsp;I signed up for, and really, really wanted to attend a SharePoint training that was being offered. &nbsp;However, as often happens, priorities changed and I was required to devote my time to something else instead, and ended up missing the training. &nbsp;However, just because I was not able to physically attend the training in person, doesn&#39;t mean that I should have had to miss it altogether. &nbsp;Had it been recorded, I could have watched it at my leisure, and still benefited from it. &nbsp;I believe that somebody mentioned the Khan Academy before, and I completely agree with the sentiment. &nbsp;I mean, one of their main selling points is their huge video library and the ability of students to learn things from videos and do so at their own pace and with the ability to go back to parts they didn&#39;t understand and re-watch them, etc... &nbsp;Why can&#39;t we do that here? &nbsp;Why can&#39;t we start recording our own training videos so that more people than just those whose schedules were free when the training was offered can benefit from that training, and can do so on their own time and at their own pace?</p>",160.109.63.190,1321646945,0,6,03/,dominiqueramirez,,

Either a second monitor or a larger screen (capable of 1600x1200 resolution or higher) are <u> </u><u>necessary</u> for the staff who perform these tasks. These screens are far more affordable than they used to be, and other Federal agencies already have them (e.g., FDA, USAID).</li><li><strong><u>Mobile devices</u></strong>. At present, we have meetings in which we take notes using pen and paper, and usually have a pile of emails waiting for us when we return. It would be more efficient if staff had laptops or tablets to take notes on in meetings, during which time staff could also stay abreast of their emails.

A frighteningly large portion of our workdays is spent waiting on our unresponsive computers. Just opening Outlook brings my system to its knees, Max.gov is almost unusable, and the K drive takes upward of 20 seconds just to display the list of files (never mind <em>opening</em> them!). Even &quot;quick&quot; tasks such as email can take 20-30 seconds during which the computer is unresponsive--long enough to exceed peoples&#39; short term memory such that you forget what you were looking for by the time it opens.

A lot of State and local information is of course grant program-specific, but many Federal education programs require coordination across programs and agencies. We have much more data on students served and performance by program and even across programs&nbsp;at our finger-tips than ever before. It would be good to be able to access more of that data and in forms that make it easier to sort through and interpret. We&#39;d develop more comprehensive or holistic pictures of our grant funds and programs operating in States, LEAs and schools, which can inform our monitoring, TA and coordination in ways that help ensure we don&#39;t miss the forest for the trees. We could focus more on program performance and continuous improvement and&nbsp;there would probably be economies of scale and other efficiencies produced as well. This is a tough challenge for ED or any Federal agency because we&#39;re not organized, trained or supervised/evaluated to work this way and it seems to require an exponential increase in what we need to know about other programs as well as how to analyze all the data meaningfully.
