This means that every time OESE staff facilitates and records a webinar (for prospective applicants, grantees, reviewers, etc.); the recorded webinar is only available for viewing for a short period of time.

Sec. Review. &nbsp; For example, it takes months to clear discretionary funding priorities through ED.&nbsp; While an&nbsp;objective observer might observe that the clearance process results in slightly improved written documents (and, perhaps, avoids some minor mistakes), there is no evidence that the months it takes to clear discretionary priorities makes a positive difference in the quality of applications received or leads to any improved outcomes for children.&nbsp; To the contrary, substantial evidence shows that resultant delays lead to less time on the street to respond to discretionary priorities and lower quality applications.</p><p>Through our clearance process, the message we give our employees is that even though you hold an advanced or even terminal degree in the professional field, there are a handful of&nbsp;less experienced operatives in ED who know better.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, this&nbsp;parochial assault on&nbsp;the basic tenants of professionalism overshadows any and all efforts to improve staff morale.&nbsp; &nbsp;Second, any great organization must have a tolerance for mistakes.&nbsp; Great organizations make mistakes along the way to greatness.&nbsp; ED, on the other hand, is so guarded against making a mistake that it hides behind technocratic or legal interpretations of often vague statutory and regulatory policies rather than taking a proactive policy position that is research-based or value-based, both of which inherently involve some risk.&nbsp; ED will never be a truly great organization unless it develops some tolerance for risk and rejects parochialism in favor of professionalism.</p>","Under Review"

We are the folks who share with another part of E.D. the work of employing outside contractors to study the effectiveness of our programs, and we also provide quick answers to questions the Secretary and those who work for him have. They often need background information, and they need it in a hurry, since someone else is pressing on them for answers.</p><p>So I go online and tetch articles from academic journals. If we don&#39;t subscribe to them or need an article not yet put online, we can get it pretty quickly. That&#39;s the nice part. The bad part is that my Web searches turn up books that look like they might have answers (or at least insights), books that the library ought to have. Half the time, the book isn&#39;t there. (The situation is getting worse and worse, as the library&#39;s budget gets more and more cut back. (I may be wrong here.))</p><p>I can get the books through Interlibrary Loan in somewhere between two days and three weeks. But the folks who want the answers will have moved on to another issue, usually in a matter of two or three days. When Harold Wilson, the former prime minister of Great Britain say, &quot;In politics, a week is a long time,&quot; he was speaking the truth.</p><p>(Even worse, almost half the library, in the sub-sub-basement of the LBJ building, has not been accessible by non-library staff for, maybe a whole decade now. It got flooded and closed &quot;temporarily.&quot; There isn&#39;t enough staff to keep it open. You can ask the staff to retreive a specific item for you, and they do so most promptly. You cannot go browse around by yourself. Many times when I wander in the stacks I pick up a book tha thas little to do with what I am researching at the moment but sounds like it would be worth looking at for some future request. This serendipity is a huge reason to retain libraries.</p><p>Also, libraries can buy things like thre thrid edition of an 8-volume International Encyclopedia of Education for $5126.26 (at a savings of $238.74 if bought from Amazon). This came out last year. We have the second edition only, which is about fifteen years old. True, education in many ways has not changed since the Middle Ages before books were printed, but much has changed in other aspects, even in fifteen years, esp. in other nations.</p><p>I should not need to recommend the purchase of this encyclopedia. It should already have been done. But there just isn&#39;t the staff to go make recommendations and the money to pay for the books.</p><p>I am not sure the policy makers realize what might be. We give them pretty good answers. At least we are regularly complimented on the quality and speediness of what we go.</p><p>I say better advice is well worth a million dollars a year.

91,"HOPE: Could we improve the internal review process?",207,1,1298389263,1317212465,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Much of the ambiguity and wasted time&nbsp;in the internal review process (e.g., Federal Register Notices) could be avoided if there were some type of <strong><em>orientation available and collective agreement as to the specific editing responsibilities and editing styles of each office</em></strong>.&rdquo;&nbsp;Currently, this process is extremely complex, unnecessarily confusing, and quite difficult to manage.&nbsp; My observation has been that ED employees spend a lot of time trying to make sense of who reviewers are, where the latest version of the priority is, and which office is responsible for which type of editing.&nbsp; For example, while review for policy and programmatic consistency, legal sufficiency and justification, and regulatory format are absolutely necessary, it is not always clear which reviewer is responsible for which area and whose opinion should be the last word. At the same time every office has a different opinion about the appropriate placement of commas and basic grammatical details; mulling over these minutia <em>delays publication, wastes time and therefore resources</em>, and <strong><em>gives potential applicants a lot less time to develop a sound proposal</em></strong>.&nbsp; As an editor hired solely for the purpose of managing this process and as an English teacher for eight years prior, I think I have a unique perspective on this issue.&nbsp; First of all, people (not just students) feel defensive and, to say the least, far from collaborative, when a document they spent a lot of time composing is saturated in red ink or &ldquo;track changes&rdquo; in this case.&nbsp; In addition, when a reviewer&rsquo;s notes go beyond a few comments per document, in other words, if the problem is conceptual, it is much more productive to call the writer or meet with the writer rather than completely annihilate his/her work. Third, every reviewer has a different editing style: some go in and change the document themselves, some only make comments, some add their new language but leave in the old, some refuse to use track changes and some change the document in addition to&nbsp;comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a better way,&nbsp;please help&nbsp;me find it--I welcome suggestions and votes&nbsp;:)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","Under Review"

The use of energy will be cut by using devices that serve multiple functions that cut the need to plug in additional equipment. For example, the all-in-one scanner, copier, fax machine has the capacity to perform the functions of three devices, alleviating the need to plug in additional equipment which increases energy use. Most departments spend a vast amount of resources on the procurement of paper and other materials that are used to conduct trainings, meetings, idea development, distribution along with other services that require multiple usage of technical (Ex. computers) and non technical equipment (Ex. flip chart holders). The spontaneity of development of ideas and the development of plans with innovative intent will be improved through the use of additional space to engage in the sharing of ideas in a clutter free training environment.

However, since our overall budget, specifically our travel budget, has decreased consistently over the past years, regional office emploiyees&nbsp;rarely have the opportunity to participate in the Department&#39;s leadership training or advanced training. A review of the training for the past 7 years will suppor this statement. Since the leadership training is usually&nbsp; a year long program and requires trainees to only attend an orientation session, a midpoint session and a ending session, why not take this training to the regions or at least consider a&nbsp;rotation with the regions adn HQ. &nbsp;All ED employees will still have the same opportunities to apply, travel to the&nbsp;location of the training (region or HQ)&nbsp;and perhaps more&nbsp;regional employees will gain the opportunity&nbsp;to advance through this training.

137,"Publicize our activities and offer more proactive FFA recipient support vs.reactive and intensive activities",386,1,1301421688,1301421688,"<p>The economy is tough, not only on our recipients and the beneficiaries of ED&#39;s federal financial assistance (FFA), but also upon the Department itself. Many of our activities (at least, of which I am aware in my own limited professional capacity) are designed to be corrective, and thus generally initiated after time and labor intensive ED agency activities. Since the various compliance-based activities within ED are typically known to relatively few members of the public-at-large, a proportionally small segment of the population in need of our attention actually benefits from our activities directly.</p><p>Yet, instead of spending the predominance of our resources to react and correct malfeasance, if all the programs and activities within ED were better known to recipients, we could work with them to better serve the beneficiaries in need from the outset. For example, instead of such heavy reliance on complaint-driven or compliance review-driven processes that serve to seek out violators and correct in a punitive way (or remedial actions that are perceived as punitive), perhaps ED could consider establishing a process whereby recipients could directly request our guidance in an individual matter. Something, perhaps, along the same lines as a complainant who can seek agency action and intervention by opening a complaint? (I note that there are technical assistance opportunities available to recipients upon request, for somewhat global inquiries, but that resource is limited, not well-known and often unused due to a misguided fear of future reprisal that prevents recipients in need from availing themselves of it.)</p><p>The way things work now, in my capacity, is that a person with a complaint about the believed non-compliance of a recipient of FFA must come to us to file a complaint before our agency can become directly involved in the invidividual matter and offer situation-specific guidance to the parties to facilitate a resolution. Otherwise, a recipient that wishes to resolve concerns must attempt (often unsuccessfully) to work with a parent or guardian in the face of deteriorated relations, mistrust and often a misunderstanding of each party&#39;s rights and responsibilities in the matter. Many would not even attempt this, becoming frustrated or feeling no obligation to do so based upon a misguided belief they are right regarding a matter about which they may not be.</p><p>Further, it is all too often that persons or organizations who represent themselves to be &quot;experts&quot; in the field mislead or misinform recipients as to their responsibilities, at considerable cost to the recipient (and essentially to the Department, from which FFA ultimately flows). The costs to the recipients -- that stem from misinformation from experts, from bad decisions due to lack of understanding of recipient staff and the defensive costs of administrative and legal fees that result from ED agency investigative activities in areas of regulatory and policy non-compliance -- take money away from educating the students to whom the money is actually intended to benefit. The problem is compounded because often those recipient employees who are misinformed remain so due to a fear of reprisal or legal rebuke of their employer if they ask for training from the recipient or call an appropriate ED agency for guidance.</p><p>Yet, the activities of the Department are vital to ensuring educational quality and equity, and so the investment in compliance activities are critical. But perhaps, if a tandem individual process could be created - where recipients could also file requests for direct ED agency assistance on a specific matter, without the fear of a punitive compliance determination or other aversive response - the savings to the recipient in time, resources and administrative and legal fees could be re-invested into the FFA recipients&#39; programs now so desperately in need of financial relief, and we could enhance the education of the beneficiaries collaterally.</p><p>I envision incorporating a kind of docketing system for recipient-initiated individual technical assistance requests, utilizing the same kinds of personnel and training - just ensuring that the work is done at the front end of a problem, more expediently and at less cost to the educational programs themselves.</p><p>The objectives of compliance with EDs policies and regulations would still be met, but this way would: (1) save time and money to ED, as investigation and correction is a more costly endeavor than providing the same information proactively; (2) foster a more trusting relationship between the recipients and ED, resulting in better quality, better informed and legally compliant educational and programmatic decisions made earlier in the process; (3) engender more public confidence in ED and the recipients, who would feel better served by the system knowing that recipients weren&#39;t left alone to fail before intervention could be accessed; (4) not likely affect the number of ED jobs or funding because, although the number of beneficiary-initiated complaints may ebb, the new recipient-docketed individual requests would generate numerous additional activities - but those which would require less resource-intensive agency response than compliance-type investigations. (This latter point would be the case because, at a minimum, there would be recipient interest and full cooperation from the outset, and not defensive efforts or legal maneuvers to conceal believed liabilities that delay the process and increasing the attendant resources and/or costs to both ED and the recipient).</p><p>If reticence to this idea is mainly due to concern that the staff may not appropriately knowledgeable or trained in the applicable areas to effectuate such actvities properly (which is not necessarily the case, from my experience), then a relatively modest investment in the appropriate training and resources would yield years of positive, cost-saving and public-trust building rewards in the future.</p><p>This is just my humble suggestion for your consideration.</p>","Awaiting Review"

Our service to our country has been marginalized and labeled as non-essential and thus unnecessary and insignificant by members of the media as well as members of Congress. Our livelihood has been put into play without consideration for the effects it would have on our families. The only federal employees who are considered worthy of their salaries and of any recognition have been members of the Armed Forces. Undoubtedly, the work our men and women do for this country is praiseworthy. However, the labor that over 800,000 of us do is also important and significant despite carrying a label of non-essential. We may not be directly responsible for life or property, but we are the individuals who assure the effectiveness and delivery of the President&rsquo;s agenda. We are the individuals responsible for the continuity and fluidity of the programs that make this country the most efficient and democratic nation in the world.</p><p>I am certain that with all the criticism and devaluation of the work we do, culminating with the perceived inevitability of a government shutdown everyone of the 800,000 employees needs a morale booster. We all had a sigh of relief on Friday evening when it was announced that the President and Congress came to an agreement to prevent the shutdown, however, that doesn&rsquo;t remedy the demoralizing aspect of having our jobs considered less than essential.</p><p>It is for this reason, that I propose that in order to help reestablish a sense of appreciation and recognition for our labor and the service we provide to this country the President himself take time from his busy schedule to visit each agency that would have been affected by the shutdown.</p><p>I believe that only our commander-in-chief could help restore the morale of all of us who have felt unappreciated and marginalized by the current political situation in our country.

A Wiki adds a more personal touch to your question by getting answers in real time from real people.

If the process will continue to be competitive, there must be transparency in the selection process to promote fairness.</p><p>Additionally, a long-term change would be to mirror the private sector more in establishing tuition reimbursement for all employees within the Department to allow each employee the opportunity for professional development and enhanced learning that the employee can then utilize in their performance on the job.</p>","Under Review"

Maxiflex provides employees and managers a wide array of scheduling options. These options provide the opportunity to schedule work around family obligations and/or personal needs. Maxiflex requires employees to work 80 hours during the pay period, but it does not require employees to work Monday - Friday 8 hours a day. Individual managers may determine whether the basic work requirement is defined as 80 hours per pay period, 40 hours per week, or even 8 hours per day. With supervisory approval, employees working Maxiflex may vary the number of hours each day and/or number of days worked each week so long as the 80 hour biweekly work requirement is completed between the flexible bands of 12:00 a.m. Monday morning through 11:59 p.m. Saturday night. Sunday may not be used to complete the regular work require-ment. Maxiflex also requires Core Time which is a period of time during which employees must be at work or in approved leave status.&nbsp; Organizations may vary their core time to fit their particular needs.

357,"Employee Morale and Opportunity at ED",472,1,1317132518,1317132518,"<p>As a relatively new employee at ED there are a few comments that I would like to make regarding the low agency satisfaction rating among employees. As a younger employee it seems that there are extreme culture differences among the younger recent employees and the older seasoned employees. Additionally, in some offices little to no interaction exists between political appointees and career employees. This agency tells the nation and the world that we don&rsquo;t want to dumb down standards; we need to race to the top, encourage innovation and creativity. Yet, within the four walls of our agency this does not exist. We work in a culture that celebrates the status quo, does not always encourage and reward innovation, and does not always work at making sure employees grow to their full potential supported by individuals in supervisory roles. In my experience, I have seen more talk and less action. What is more, when an employee brings up a topic that leadership does not want to deal with it is usually dismissed with a poor excuse or little reason as to why they will not comply with the request.</p><p>Additionally, not every employee is motivated by the money. Some are desperately seeking experience and training and want to acquire more skills and knowledge that would be beneficial to the agency as a whole. Just because a career employee does not come in as an intern or PMF does not mean that they do not possess the same talents and should not be awarded the same opportunities or recognition. It could be that as a student they were not informed about the PMF program. Some employees are coming into entry level positions fresh out of school with lots of ideas and motivation and when that is not cultivated and capitalized upon by leadership, the employee may become complacent and look elsewhere. Provided that, it would be helpful if ED created a support / training network for new employees (only for those who desire to take part) that allows them to work in their POC and have support by the agency to grow in skills with other POCs and figure out where their talents would be best suited within the agency during their first 3 years. This would be a great alternative for offices that do not support detail opportunities. That may encourage a sense of belonging to ED and desire to continue to contribute to the agency. Therefore, it has the potential to create a climate with increased productivity and satisfaction. The Emerging Leaders Program provided some of that opportunity but, it has disappeared from the leadership courses. When employees feel shut down with no future or growth in sight, motivation and morale drop significantly leading to low satisfaction of the agency as a whole.</p><p>In conclusion, ED has the potential to be a great agency.

I have been observing how the Department has made so many attempts at letting teachers know that the Department shares their concerns, that RTT isn&#39;t the enemy, that we don&#39;t do standardized testing, that there is no such thing as national standards and yet they seem to always oppose any measure, simply because they don&#39;t want accountability. I think that ED&#39;s greater focus should be with letting parents know that we are doing everything we can to make sure their children get the best education possible. Let parents know that we have the children&#39;s best interest in mind, instead of trying to get all teachers approval. I think that most teachers share and understand the role and focus of ED. By no means do I suggest we ignore them, but I think enough focus has been placed on them and ED should distribute its efforts more evenly by engaging parents.</p><p>I think that there should be a tax credit provided to parents who are actively engaged in their children&#39;s education;parents who take the necessary measures to prevent truancy.

time, our tax dollars, etc., it is more than a matter of&nbsp;intellectual curiousity whether&nbsp;&quot;Does this stuff work?&quot;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2.<strong> Is the&nbsp;nation getting value-for-money in on-line learning?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>Where do we need to target&nbsp;research contracts and grants&nbsp;to improve teaching and learning as quickly and efficiently as feasible?</strong></p><p><strong>The findings in the&nbsp;ED/OPEPD&nbsp;report on&nbsp;&quot;Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in Online Learning: A&nbsp;Meta-Analysis and&nbsp;Review of Online Learning Studies&quot;&nbsp;are not encouraging (<a href=""http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/tech/evidence-based-praties/finalreport.pdf"">http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/tech/evidence-based-praties/finalreport.pdf</a> )&nbsp;.&nbsp; The&nbsp;analysis by Barbara Means et al. covered over a dozen years of research (studies published between&nbsp;1996 and&nbsp;July 2008).&nbsp; It identified 1132&nbsp;articles reporting empirical research on distance&nbsp;learning&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine percent #99)&nbsp;of the studies dealt with K-12 education).</strong></p><p><strong>Only&nbsp;50 of those studies used experimental or quasi-experimental designs with credible comparison groups.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of those studies,&nbsp;just 9 dealt with&nbsp;K-12 education--and only 5&nbsp;of those K-12 studies were&nbsp;rigorous enough to&nbsp;include in analysis.</strong></p><p><strong>That is, for our entire nation and beyond--for a period of over a&nbsp;dozen years (and with millions of dollars invested in education&nbsp;technology by ED)--we averaged less than half&nbsp;a published methodology credible study a&nbsp;year.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp;those studies were&nbsp;often small and/or had other serious methodological problems.</strong></p><p><strong>The situation is even worse when teachers, parents and taxpayers look for the specifics of &quot;what works&quot;&nbsp;(and what doesn&#39;t) in on-line&nbsp;teaching and&nbsp;learning.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;ED/OPEPD&nbsp;reported that from&nbsp;1994 through 2006 there were no experimental or&nbsp;quasi-experimental design studies of K-12 online education that compared traditional &quot;face-to-face&quot; teacher instructions with online instruction.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;Too often this gap in ED and other research makes&nbsp;&quot;evidence-based practice&quot; in online&nbsp;education impossible at this time.</strong></p><p><strong>This&nbsp;is not unique.&nbsp; Unfortunately,&nbsp;credible research&nbsp;remains&nbsp;scarce in area after area of education.&nbsp; For&nbsp;example, the President&#39;s&nbsp;National Mathematics&nbsp;Advisory&nbsp;Panel&#39;s&nbsp;final report, issued in 2008, reviewed the&nbsp;research evidence on&nbsp;how to teach mathematics&nbsp;for high achievement.&nbsp;&nbsp;This included review of most key aspects of how to&nbsp;teach math, including curriculum design, use of testing, use of calculators, teacher training, and so on.</strong></p><p><strong>The NMAP experts on the panel&nbsp;often had strong opinions on how to teach math (and the &quot;experts&quot; often disagreed)--but what was particularly&nbsp;striking was that in area after area&nbsp;NMAP reported--after reviewing&nbsp;thousands of studies--that there simply was not enough rigorous&nbsp;research on&nbsp;&quot;what works&quot; to&nbsp;make any evidence-based recommendations in many key areas about how to teach mathematics (<a href=""http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/index.html"">http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/index.html</a>).</strong></p><p><strong>Even data on what research and other&nbsp;agencies are&nbsp;conducing are&nbsp;often hard to locate.&nbsp; The President&#39;s Commission for the&nbsp;Study of Bioethical&nbsp;Issues (PCSBI)&nbsp;data call to the&nbsp;federal agencies&nbsp;, including&nbsp;ED, found it difficult or impossible to provide much of the basic information because their grants and contracts management&nbsp;systems simply were not set up to collect and report that data (<a href=""http://bioethics.gov/cms/node/558"">http://bioethics.gov/cms/node/558</a>&nbsp;).&nbsp; The&nbsp;Commission&#39;s&nbsp;first recommendation to&nbsp;the President, which&nbsp;it descries as&nbsp;key, is that the agencies upgrade their&nbsp;information&nbsp;systems to provide this research&nbsp;information--with data definitions&nbsp;etc. that produce comparable information across&nbsp;agencies.&nbsp; In times of tight budgets, it is important that agencies have&nbsp;information systems that allow them to know what research they are conducting--including&nbsp;its rigor, research topics, trends, the impact of that research, etc.&nbsp; (Several ED program offices, including FIPSE, OELA and OVAE&nbsp;did not report that they conducted&nbsp;any human subjects research&nbsp;during that five year period.)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Upgraded information systems are not enough--the production function&nbsp;also matters.</strong></p><p><strong>ED, like several other agencies, has many grant programs--and the grant terms,&nbsp;as&nbsp;insisted by Congress, require evaluation of the interventional performance.&nbsp; Often&nbsp;the resulting performance information is never&nbsp;used--and is often unusable.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;some time ago a review of Title VII grantee&nbsp;evaluations of performance&nbsp;concluded that the&nbsp;information from grantee evaluations&nbsp;essentially could not be used due to&nbsp;serious methodological problems.&nbsp; This is not unusual.&nbsp; A couple of years&nbsp;ago,&nbsp;when a safe and&nbsp;drug free schools grant was found by the IRB to be out of compliance with 34 CFR 97 could not&nbsp;be used, ED program staff observed that&nbsp;the data loss wasn&#39;t really much of a problem, because the performance data from the&nbsp;evaluations was usually not used.&nbsp; And&nbsp;so on.</strong></p><p><strong>We can do better.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time ago, Congress mandated&nbsp;an independent report on &quot;what works&quot;&nbsp;in crime reduction and law enforcement.&nbsp; The 1998 report,&nbsp;&quot;Preventing Crime: What Works, What&nbsp;Doesn&#39;t, What&#39;s Promising&quot; by Lawrence Sherman et al. found&nbsp;that at that time there&nbsp;simply was not&nbsp;much known about &quot;what works&quot; in&nbsp;preventing crime because the necessary research had not been done.&nbsp; Among the&nbsp;notable recommendations&nbsp;in the report&nbsp;was that the&nbsp;grant evaluations be upgraded so that they provide scientifically credible information rather than wasting tax dollars.&nbsp; Given the scarcity of funds for evaluating crime&nbsp;prevention programs, the report recommended that strong&nbsp;research designs be strongly encouraged or required for programs-- and&nbsp;urged that evaluation&nbsp;funds and expertise be concentrated among the grants to produce scientifically credible data on&nbsp;&quot;what works&quot;, rather&nbsp;than wasting the resources on &quot;paper-chase&quot; evaluations that meet grant requirements but that produce useless information.&nbsp; In the&nbsp;intervening decade, we have&nbsp;seen a considerable strengthening of evidence-based crime prevention (and generlly&nbsp;declining rates which may be, in part,&nbsp;related.)</strong></p><p><strong>We have seen some similar developments in ED.&nbsp; For example, it has become increasingly common in&nbsp;ED grant competitions to require that&nbsp;funded grantees conduct rigorous&nbsp;evaluations, as well as a trend toward increasingly rigorous evaluations of programs&nbsp;as a whole.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5.&nbsp;<strong>Where is ED?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>ED&nbsp;research included more than the work of IES and NIDRR.&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp;program research is particularly important in translating findings from the &quot;lab&quot;&nbsp;to practical&nbsp;practice&nbsp;in the nation&#39;s&nbsp;classrooms.</strong></p><p><strong>ED has made major strides in recent&nbsp;years in upgrading the rigor and objectivity&nbsp;of its research, and in creating the What Works Clearinghouse and other resources for evidence-based practice.&nbsp; (One notable aspect of many of the WWC&nbsp;evidence-based reviews is just how few rigorous studies&nbsp;there currently are&nbsp;for many key interventions and on how they&nbsp;work across diverse schools and student populations.)&nbsp; Clearly much&nbsp;remains to be done for&nbsp;effective design, implementation and use of the ED&nbsp;research portfolio.</strong></p><p><strong>To&nbsp;provide needed infrastructure&nbsp;and leadership, three actions to upgrade the ED research infrastrcture are particularly important at this time:</strong></p><p><strong>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ED information systems.&nbsp; As noted by the Presidential Commission (PCSBI), ED should upgrade its&nbsp;grant and contract&nbsp;management systems to provide adequate,&nbsp;real-time information on an ongoing&nbsp;basis about&nbsp;what&nbsp;research it is funding (including under program grants).&nbsp; This is basic information for designing and managing a coherent and efficient&nbsp;research&nbsp;portfolio to&nbsp;move the Department and the nation beyond&nbsp;the deplorable &quot;evidence&nbsp;free&quot; policy&nbsp;ennvironment noted&nbsp;by the OPEPD&nbsp;study, NMAP,&nbsp;PCSBI and others.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ED grants and contracts (and risk management) should&nbsp;require&nbsp;methodologically credible performance information to provide&nbsp;knowledge of what&nbsp;works, and to enable&nbsp;continuous&nbsp;improvement.&nbsp; Several&nbsp;ED programs have made major strides in this area in recent years--and this&nbsp;should&nbsp;be built on.&nbsp; Indeed, this is part of ED&#39;s basic program design and risk management.</strong></p><p><strong>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ED-funded research: Transparency and impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, education&nbsp;research often remains unpublished and hard to access.&nbsp; Research funded by ED (including&nbsp;credible grant and program evaluations) should be readily accessible to ED staff and the public,&nbsp;and transparent. Part of the problem&nbsp;noted&nbsp;by the OPEPD report may be that&nbsp;important ED-funded research is often&nbsp;not published.&nbsp; For example, our staff&#39;s review of studies in several areas in special education&nbsp;included in meta-analyses&nbsp;found that a large proportion (I&nbsp;think it was roughly&nbsp;half) of the cited studies&nbsp;had never been&nbsp;published.&nbsp; This is not unusual in education.</strong></p><p><strong>NIH, at&nbsp;Congressional urging, requires that the research that it funds be made&nbsp;publicly&nbsp;available on&nbsp;a timely basis (<a href=""http://publicaccess.nih.gov/"">http://publicaccess.nih.gov/</a> ).&nbsp; This helps provide transparency&nbsp;about the quality of the nation&#39;s investment in health research, and makes that information&nbsp;available to&nbsp;other&nbsp;researchers and to the&nbsp;broader&nbsp;community.&nbsp; ED should adopt a&nbsp;similar model of&nbsp;access and&nbsp;transparency.&nbsp; (In part, making the results publiclly&nbsp;available helps drive the competition and accountability pressures for continued improvement.&nbsp;)&nbsp; It may be possible to do this&nbsp;under current policy, but like the NIH requirement, it could be included in the ESEA reauthorization or other education&nbsp;legislation.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In sum, &nbsp;each of these three&nbsp;&nbsp;initiatives requires few new resources and are mutually reinforcing to strengthen ED leadership and to allow more effective management of its&nbsp;&quot;lean and mean&quot;&nbsp;research&nbsp;portfolio (e.g. in&nbsp;comparison to NIH&#39;s research volume and quality).</strong></p><p><strong>Please let me&nbsp;know if you need&nbsp;additional information&nbsp;or have any questions.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Awaiting Review"

By implementing the sound feature will mitigate the number of employees and contractors from leaving their PIV cards in the keyboard slot during breaks, lunch time, meetings and the end-of-the-day departures.&nbsp;</p><p>At the present, daily, there are employees and contractors that inadvertently leave their PIVs at their desks.&nbsp; As a result, added security measures that are necessary to ensure our buildings are secure, must be taken for employees and contractors to re-entry to their perceptive buildings first thing in the morning, after meetings and after lunch.&nbsp; At the end of the day, the repetitive security measures waste valuable time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Time is money!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","Under Review"

734,"Adopt ""Transit Fringe Benefit"" – Under IRS Regs",1067,1,1410365712,1410365712,"<p><strong>Summary: </strong>Current IRS Regs allow employees to set aside pre-tax dollars (up to $400 per month) for the purpose of mass transit. This &quot;transit-fringe benefit&quot; takes the form of a payroll deduction, no different than medical premiums, TSP deductions, et cetera. However, unlike other deductions, there is no &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; clause. The idea below calls for ED to adopt this benefit, so that ED/FSA employees can avail&nbsp;the same&nbsp;benefit already being used by many other employees. <em><strong>No one should pay a tax just to get to work.</strong></em></p><p><strong>Background</strong>: The Internal Revenue Code Section 132 and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) allows employers to offer employees the opportunity to set aside a portion of their salary to pay for certain transportation expenses.Under the IRS regulations and TEA-21, employees can set aside up to $250 for parking and $130 for mass transit (on a monthly basis) and the amounts will be pre-tax (IRC &sect;132(f)(2); RP 2013-35). The maximum allowable amount is $400 when you include biking fees.</p><p>I believe it would be worth considering the adoptions of wonderful benefit, as it would be helpful for <strong><em>all</em></strong> employees, carries no overhead costs, and imposes very <strong><em>little</em></strong> administrative cost.</p><p>Both regional and HQ employees rely on public transit to commute, and the current transit benefit only covers a tiny portion of the actual cost of getting to work. Allowing employees the opportunity to avail this benefit provided by IRS regulations will ensure that employees are not being &ldquo;taxed&rdquo; just to get to work.</p><p>This transit fringe benefit would take the form of a payroll deduction, on a pre-tax basis, no different than medical premiums, TSP deductions, et cetera.
